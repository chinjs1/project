Postmortem for migration of GL and MM:

We dockerized our production servers, GL and MM. The reason for doing this is so we have a current & up-to-date version for testing purposes, an up-to-date container
for us to roll back to if anything drastic happens and for ease of management by having it dockerized.

user communication:
	
	We posted announcements on GL & MM 3 days prior to the maintainence took place. Another thing we could have done to notify people better is to post on the Slack
	channel and the BIT FaceBook page.

steps involved:
	
	As we had already deployed the dockerized versions in the testing environments, we followed the instructions that were already prepared. This included the
	following: 
	
		- Installing docker,
		- Installing docker-compose,
		- Pulling the relevant service repo from GL containing the docker files,
		- Setup the new machines, once they are ready - take the old machine down (the purpose of this is so you can pull the repo from GL),
		- Run scripts to backup GL/MM on the old machine, copy it to the new machine, ran the restore script * https://gitlab.op-bit.nz/bit-platform/BIT-Useful-Scripts/tree/master,
		- Re route the DNS to the new IP address of the new machine,
		- Test that everything was working correctly,
		- Annoucned that services were back up and running.
		
lessons learned:
	
	We could have checked for open ports before deployment. An issue we had was wanting to re-direct SSH to port 2222 but the OP firewall was blocking that. How we got around
	this issue was to contact ISS about opening some potential ports for us to use.
